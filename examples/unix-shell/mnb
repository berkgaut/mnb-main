# Figure out script absolute location, which would be the path to the mnb workspace.
#
# In general, determining script location is non-trivial, but we do several simplifying assumptions:
# - This script would never be sourced, only executed
# - Symlinks are not resolved, i.e. if the script or the containing directory is a symlink,
#   then the path to mnb workspace would contain that symblink
